# Mapcycle Generator

A program for creating a mapcycle file for TF2 game servers from valve's official casual map rotation.

## Usage

The data is extracted from **items_game.txt**. You need to provide a full path to the items_game.txt file.

Example: `./tf2-mapcycle-generator --itemsgame-path "/home/tf2server/serverfiles/tf/scripts/items/items_game.txt"`

The output file will be printed to the terminal.
